 * ows

 *   .pipeThrough(
 *     ows.subchain(o =>
 *       o
 *         .pipeThrough(ows.map(() => fetch("/stockData")))

 *   .pipeTo(
 *     ows.discard(data => {

 *
 * @typeparam S Type of items emitted by the original observable.
 * @typeparam T Type of items returned by the observable `f` returns.
 * @param f Function that will be applied to the observable.
 * @returns Transform that applies `f` to the observable.
